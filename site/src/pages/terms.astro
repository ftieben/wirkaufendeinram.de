      <p>
        <strong>This is a parody website</strong> inspired by automotive buying platforms like "wirkaufendeinauto.de" 
        but focused on computer RAM instead of cars. While the concept and design are satirical in nature, 
        <strong>all RAM purchasing services offered are genuine and legally compliant</strong>.

      <p>
        This parody falls under fair use and parody protection guidelines. We do not claim any affiliation 
        with or endorsement by the original automotive platforms that inspired this concept.
